# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project, I created a password generator using Javascript. This program takes in user criteria on what they want in their password (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters) and how long they want their password to be. An error message will occur when when an incorrect input for the length is submitted and when no password options are checked.
